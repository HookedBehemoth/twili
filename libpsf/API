PSF_MODE_HAS_TAB
PSF_MODE_HAS_SEQ
PSF_MODE_MAX



Structures:

struct psf_font
Structure used for storing PSF font information. Its has several members
described as follows:

	void *psf_fd;
This is the file handle used for opening and reading the font file. You 
should (probably) not use this in your programs because it may not be 
what you expect depending on how libpsf is built.

	char psf_type;
This will be one of PSF_TYPE_1, PSF_TYPE_2, or PSF_TYPE_UNKNOWN after 
the PSF font header has been read using psf_read_header, depending on
which type of PSF file is opened.

	unsigned char psf_magic[2];
Stores magic bytes used internally to differntiate between PSF_TYPE_1 
and PSF_TYPE_2.

	char psf_mode;
Flags, can be any combination of PSF_MODE_512, PSF_MODE_HAS_TAB, 
PSF_MODE_HAS_SEQ, or PSF_MODE_MAX. Only set if PSF_TYPE_1

	char psf_charsize;
Size of PSF character if PSF_TYPE_1

	unsigned char psf2_magic[4];
Stores magic bytes used internally to differntiate between PSF_TYPE_1 
and PSF_TYPE_2.

	int	psf2_version;
Minor version of PSF, should always be 0.

	int	psf2_headersize;
Size in bytes of header

	int	psf2_flags;
Flags, can be either PSF2_HAS_UNICODE_TABLE or 0. Only set if PSF_TYPE_2

	int	psf2_length;
Total number of chars if PSF_TYPE_2

	int	psf2_charsize;
Total size of each glyph in PSF_TYPE_2 font in bytes.

	int	psf2_width,psf2_height;
Total width and height of each glyph in PSF_TYPE_2 font.



Functions:

void psf_open(struct psf_font *font, char *fname);

This function opens fname for reading.
It takes two arguments which are a pointer to a psf_font structure, and 
the file name and path of the font to open.


void psf_read_header(struct psf_font *font)

This function reads the PSF header of the currently open font and stores the
information. This function must be called before attempting to read glyphs from
the font.


int psf_get_glyph_size(struct psf_font *font)

This function returns the glyph size in bytes of the specified PSF font.
This function cannot be called before psf_read_header has been called for the 
specified psf_font.


int psf_get_glyph_height(struct psf_font *font)

This function returns the glyph height in bits of the specified PSF font.
This function cannot be called before psf_read_header has been called for the 
specified psf_font.


int psf_get_glyph_width(struct psf_font *font)

This function returns the glyph width in bits of the specified PSF font.
This function cannot be called before psf_read_header has been called for the 
specified psf_font.


int psf_get_glyph_total(struct psf_font *font)

This function returns the number of glyphs in the specified PSF font.
This function cannot be called before psf_read_header has been called for the 
specified psf_font.


void psf_read_glyph(struct psf_font *font, void *mem, int size, int fill, int clear)

This function reads one glyph from the font file and stores the character in
the memory location pointed to by mem.
This function takes five arguments.
The first is a pointer to a psf_font structure (which has already be filled by 
psf_read_header)
The second is a pointer to a block of memory which has already been allocated and
will store the glyph read from the file.
The third is the bytes per pixel of the surface pointed to by mem (output pixel
format).
The fourth is the value to use for solid pixels.
The fifth is the value to use for empty pixels.


void psf_close_font()

This function closes the specified PSF font. Closing a font will not destroy data
read from the font, nor the contents of the psf_font structure. It only closes the 
file descriptor.
